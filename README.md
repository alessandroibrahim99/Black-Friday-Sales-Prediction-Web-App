# Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction-Web-App
A web app containing 5 models that predict the sales on black friday dataset. This is a practice problem on Analytics Vidhya.


When you click on any of the 5 models on the  webapp, it is going to download a csv file for that model.

You can use this prediction file and make a submission on your Analytics Vidhya account.

I have used Flask for this and Bootstrap Studio for making the fronend of the website.
