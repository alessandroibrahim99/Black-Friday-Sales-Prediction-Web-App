# Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction-Web-App
A web app containing 5 models that predict the sales on black friday dataset. This is a practice problem on Analytics Vidhya.

NOTE: I couldnt upload the decision tree model(.sav) file since it 68mb.
Here is the link to the website:
https://blackfriday-sales.herokuapp.com/

When you click on any of the 5 models on the  webapp, it is going to download a csv file for that model.

You can use this prediction file and make a submission on your Analytics Vidhya account.
I have used Flask for this and Bootstrap Studio for making the frontend of the website.

The blackfriday.py file is the model that will create the 5 ML models. The app.py is the file that you need to run using flask. The index.html in the templates folder is the website.

I have uploaded the saved models files(.sav), so that you can directly run the app.py file.
